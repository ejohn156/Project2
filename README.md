# Project Fitness

## About
Our idea for this project will be to create a fitness app. As of now the app will contain two main sections, the user profile, and workouts. A profile will be created for every new user and will take in health information that the user will provide. For example, the user may enter their height and weight, and the app will then calculate the user’s BMI. Users will be able to update their health information whenever they please and the app will store all these updates so one may view their progress. The app will also gather the user’s fitness goals and provide the user a place to organize their fitness strategies to help them accomplish those goals.  The application will also provide motivational quotes for the user as well as providing a place for the user to log their progress. 
- The app will also have a custom workouts feature where a user can create their own workout and post them to the site. These custom workouts will be able to be updated by the creator and viewed by other users. Along with being able to post and update their own workouts the user can also browse workouts that have been posted by other users.
